# Cellular-Automata / Conway's game of life
This project implements the Conway's game of life (also refered to as cellular automata) in C through a TUI that runs under a terminal-emulator. The Ncurses library was used to create the application's 2D game-like user interface.

## Installation & How to use
The program can be executed either by downloading the documents through a zipfile or cloning the repository to a local device through the following commandline argument: `git clone https://github.com/Robinwohner/Cellular-Automata`. Compile the program with the Ncurses library: `gcc -o ca ca.c -lncurses`. Finally run the program, `./ca` and follow the instructions on the screen.
